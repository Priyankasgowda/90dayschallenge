# Program for Fibonacci numbers
# The Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence.
# 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ……..

# In mathematical terms, the sequence Fn of Fibonacci numbers is defined by the recurrence relation


# Function for nth Fibonacci number 
  
def Fibonacci(n): 
    if n<0: 
        print("Incorrect input") 
    # First Fibonacci number is 0 
    elif n==0:

    else: 
        return Fibonacci(n-1)+Fibonacci(n-2)
